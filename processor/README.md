# Payment Integration Processor

This module provides an application based on [commercetools Connect](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect), which is triggered by HTTP requests from Checkout UI for payment operations.

The corresponding payment, cart or order details would be fetched from composable commerce platform, and then be sent to external PSPs for various payment operations such as create/capture/cancel/refund payment.

The module also provides template scripts for post-deployment and pre-undeployment action. After deployment or before undeployment via connect service completed, customized actions can be performed based on users' needs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Please run following npm commands under `processor` folder.

#### Install dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

#### Build the application in local environment. NodeJS source codes are then generated under dist folder

```
$ npm run build
```

#### Run automation test

```
$ npm run test
```

#### Run the application in local environment. Remind that the application has been built before it runs

```
$ npm run start
```

#### Fix the code style

```
$ npm run lint:fix
```

#### Verify the code style

```
$ npm run lint
```

#### Run post-deploy script in local environment

```
$ npm run connector:post-deploy
```

#### Run pre-undeploy script in local environment

```
$ npm run connector:pre-undeploy
```

## Running application

Setup correct environment variables: check `processor/src/config/config.ts` for default values.

Make sure commercetools client credential have at least the following permissions:

- `manage_payments`
- `manage_orders`
- `manage_customers`
- `manage_checkout_payment_intents`
- `view_sessions`
- `introspect_oauth_tokens`

```
npm run dev
```

## Authentication

Some of the services have authentication mechanism.

- `oauth2`: Relies on commercetools OAuth2 server
- `session`: Relies on commercetools session service
- `jwt`: Relies on the jwt token injected by the merchant center via the forward-to proxy

### OAuth2

OAuth2 token can be obtained from commercetools OAuth2 server. It requires API Client created beforehand. For details, please refer to [Requesting an access token using the Composable Commerce OAuth 2.0 service](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/authorization#requesting-an-access-token-using-the-composable-commerce-oauth-20-service).

### Session

Payment connectors relies on session to be able to share information between `enabler` and `processor`.
To create session before sharing information between these two modules, please execute following request to commercetools session service. This code snippet can be used in your custom application as well.

```
POST https://session.<region>.commercetools.com/<commercetools-project-key>/sessions
Authorization: Bearer <oauth token with manage_sessions scope>

{
  "cart": {
    "cartRef": {
      "id": "<cart-id>"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    processorUrl: "<processor-url>",
    merchantReturnUrl: "<merchant-return-url>",
    "allowedPaymentMethods": ["Monext"],
  }
}
```

Afterwards, session ID can be obtained from response, which is necessary to be put as `x-session-id` inside request header when sending request to endpoints such as `/operations/config` and `/payment`.

```
# Start a payment using X-Session-Id

export const submit = async (
  paymentMethod: string,
  languageCode: string,
  sessionId: string
) => {
  const requestData = {
    paymentMethod: paymentMethod,
    languageCode,
  };
  const response = await fetch(
    import.meta.env.VITE_PROCESSOR_URL + "/payment",
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "X-Session-Id": sessionId,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(requestData),
    }
  );
  const data = await response.json();

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Some error occurred. Please try again.");
  }
  return data;
};
```

### JSON web token (JWT)

`jwt` needs some workaround to be able to test locally as it depends on the merchant center forward-to proxy.

In order to make easy running the application locally, following commands help to build up a jwt mock server:

#### Set environment variable to point to the jwksUrl

```
export CTP_JWKS_URL="http://localhost:9000/jwt/.well-known/jwks.json"

```

#### Run the jwt server

```
docker compose up -d

```

#### Obtain JWT

```
# Request token

curl --location 'http://localhost:9000/jwt/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "iss": "https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com",
  "sub": "subject",
  "https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com/claims/project_key": "<commercetools-project-key>"
}'

```

Token can be found in response.

```
{"token":"<token>"}

```

Use the token to authenticate requests protected by JWT: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## APIs

The processor exposes following endpoints to execute various operations with Monext platform:

| endpoints      | Method | URL                                    | Call Monext API | Use Payment Id | Authentication Method                                 |

  ]
}

```

- metadata: It lists a collection of metadata including the name/description of the connector and the version of SDKs used to connect to external system.

### POST createPayment

Endpoint called by the merchant to provide the data for payment creation payment creation in the Monext API.

#### Endpoint

`POST /payment`

#### Request Parameters

```
{
  languageCode?: <Language-of-payment-hosted-page>,
  paymentMethod: "monext"
}
```

The language by default is EN.

#### Response Parameters

It returns following attributes in response:

- redirectURL: Return two possibles URL, the payment hosted page URL or the merchant return URL with paymentReference = `paymentsId` as query parameter.

```
{
  redirectURL: <url-to-redirect>
}
```

In the front of the merchant site a redirect is required. This redirect is already included within the enabler code.

```
submit("monext", languageCode, sessionId).then((data) => {
      if (data.redirectURL) {
        window.location.replace(data.redirectURL);
      } else {
        throw new Error("Some error occurred. Please try again.");
      }
    });
```

### GET confirmPayment

Confirms a payment by updating the payment in Commercetools and the Monext API.

#### Endpoint

`GET /return`

#### Query Parameters

```
{
    token: <monext-session-id>,
    paymentReference: <paymentId>
}
```

#### Response Parameters

It returns following attributes in response:

- paymentReference: The Commercetools payment id reference.
- returnUrl: Merchant return url configured in the connector environment variables. Includes `paymentReference = paymentsId` as query parameter.

```
{
  paymentReference: <paymentId>,
  returnUrl: <merchant-return-url>
}
```

Considering that the plugin is not currently compatible with Commercetools checkout, we can use the query parameter `paymentReference` for recovering the Cart Id [Using Query Carts and passing `paymentReference` as QueryPredicate](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/carts#query-carts).

Once you have the Cart Id, you can [use the endpoint for Create order from cart](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/orders#create-order-from-cart)

```
# Payload example for create order from cart

const body = {
      cart: {
        id: <cart-id>,
        typeId: "cart",
      },
      paymentState: <payment-status>,
      shipmentState: <shipment-status>,
      orderState; <order-status>,
      version: <cart-version>,
    };
```

### GET notifyPayment

Notifies the payment to the processor when the confirmPayment method is not called.

#### Endpoint

`GET /notification/{paymentId}`

#### Request Parameters

```
{
    paymentId: <payment-reference>;
}
```

#### Query Parameters

```
{
    notificationType: <Monext-notification-type>,
    token: <monext-session-id>,
    paymentEndpoint: <Monext-payment-endpoint>
}
```

Currently, notificationType and paymentEndpoint are not being used in the module.

#### Response Parameters

```
{
    status: <payment-status>,
